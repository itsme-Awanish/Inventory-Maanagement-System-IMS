# Inventory_management_system
The Inventory Management System (IMS) is a vital application designed to streamline and automate inventory-related tasks within an organization. It serves as a central hub for tracking stock levels, recording transactions, and generating essential reports.
In this project, I focus on creating a web-based application that efficiently handles inventory management. Our system aims to provide an intuitive interface for managing stock, ensuring accuracy, and optimizing resource utilization.
In IMS I have tried to make the entire processes (user registration and management, category registration and management, product registration and management, orders and inventory process) computer based and automatically. Accordingly the process, the procedure of managing an inventory is same as traditional, but it would be faster, accurate, and secure also.
